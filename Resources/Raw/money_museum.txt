#Description of the Museum

The Money Museum is located next to Szell Kalman Square in District 2 at Krisztina korut 6 and is owned by the National Bank of Hungary. Its main purpose is to educate youth about dealing with money from a modern perspective. It also gives the audience, of any age group, thorough input on the history of Hungarian and global finance. It was opened on March 15th 2022, following a minimum of four years planning to create the high-quality exhibitions, interactive material and virtual simulation games. The museum is entertaining for all ages as identification cards are assigned to specific age groups to give all guests an age-appropriate experience. The building is clean, well-organised and clearly modern; including a pleasant cafe and open entrance area, lockers for coats and bags and a lit-up path designed to guide guests across the journey of money. Made for our current generation, who are growing up in a time dominated by finance, the museum addresses the cruciality of learning about money and how to handle it responsibly. It is informative whilst undoubtedly fun and entertaining!

We give The Money Museum a recommendation score of 10/10 for students of any age alongside parents and the elderly as it provides new information for all those who visit. Visit the Money Museum and learn about the past, present and future of global finance!

#Description of The Exhibition 

The guided tour of The Money Museum includes information about the actual origin of money and how it has developed over time. It starts off by giving us an idea of how bartering in the world worked before 'money' existed. After that, they introduce how civilians discovered the value of money and how they tried to find different items that were suitable for it. Metal, specifically gold was found and the museum itself holds many artefacts and tools that were used back in the day, such as pickaxes, hammers, etc. Real artefacts are displayed such as gold items (thread, nugget and bars) as well that are worth over $600. There is also a display of ancient coins and notes with information on who contributed to the discoveries. A thing that we found interesting was that they installed shredded money inside some of the chairs!

The museum explains the evolution of money coins through bills of exchange and bank notes. It uses fun virtual interactive games to make the journey enjoyable. It also explores the 5 functions of money using a range of exhibits, games and videos. 

Another interesting addition that they provide is an interactive knowledge board in which you can read information about the history of finance in Hungary itself. In this part of the museum, there are over 70 videos that you can watch and even more information to read. You can visit this part of the museum without registering beforehand.

#Tips and Suggestions for Future Visitors

Watch out for special occasions or the museum night, held every summer, as it is the most well-known date for visiting The Money Museum. It is extraordinary and offers a much more visual input to the museum alongside speakers and opportunities to ask questions to members of staff and experts. However, make sure to arrive early to secure an RFID card to engage in the interactive games.

#Top 5 fun facts

1. The Golden Thread goes through the whole museum to help guide your way through. This analogy comes from a person named, Ariadne (in Greek mythology), who fell in love with Theseus, and he used the golden thread to find his way out of a labyrinth.

2. 67,009 people visited The Money Museum in 2022 (they opened on 15th March, which is Hungarian Independence Day).

3. The National Bank also has a fine arts collection program which was launched in 2014 and completed in 2018during which time they spent 28M Euros on art treasures.

4. The renovation of the museum building was finished in 2022, as its official construction of the permanent exhibition due to governmental measures had to be taken into consideration. 

5. There is a statue of a golden train (made from golden blocks) halfway inside, halfway outside the museum. It commemorates the employees of the national bank who during WW2 carried the gold reserves and valuables of the Hungarian bank away from the country to secure it until after the war.
