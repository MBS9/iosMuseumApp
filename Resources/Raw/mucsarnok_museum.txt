#Personal Impressions

Keith: It has beautifully renovated interiors, with spacious exhibition halls, and exhibits mostly made in Hungary and produced in domestic workshops can be seen.  Unique plans and ideas line up before our eyes.  Valuable hours can be spent here; the cheerful atmosphere of the visitors makes them forget the outside world just for a moment. 

Thomas: Creative and breath-taking statues can be seen. All the arts are handmade by genius artists. You can see modern and ancient Hungarian art, which makes the visitors love the museum even more.

Judit: I think it was very interesting and thought provoking, as it was an attention-grabbing exhibit, full of beautiful sculptures that represent important ideologies, or that try to convey and embody abstract concepts and ideas. I would definitely choose to spend my time here. 

Srinika:: I think the exhibition was amazing and exciting. We got to watch six exhibitions of different artists. Some were tragic, and some were joyful. I had fun watching all the models. Me and Judit enjoyed making shadows in some of the art which had projectors. I really liked the guided tour, and I would definitely visit it again sometime soon!
