#Description of The Exhibitions 

The museum is mostly about machines and technical appliances containing more than 18000 items in total. The exhibition of the museum is organized like a storage unit, but they all usually have a short description attached to them so you know what they are and when they were built/used. Items are placed in sections, each section showing a certain type of machine or appliance, for example, telescopes or typewriters. The item that comes closest to being called the main piece in the exhibition is a 1950s Soviet computer (it certainly is one of the largest ones), but in general the museum does not have main items, each has their own uniqueness and feel. There are few temporary exhibitions (e.g. on the history of data storage), everything is there to stay and to be shown.
